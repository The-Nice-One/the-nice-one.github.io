Some of my artwork created throughout the years. In particular pixel-art which I find very appealing and fun to draw.

\header{Midnight}{midnight}

Created November 9th, 2022, this image became my avatar on Github. It pictures a tree posistioned to the right, on a midnight sky.

Created summer of 2025, this scene uses the [The Crow](https://lospec.com/palette-list/the-crow) color palette. It depicts a train traveling through a night sky with a handful of animations giving life to the scene. Additionally, this artwork doubles as a playground project as the frames where generated using Julia. Read more about the project [here](/playground/train-night-scene/index.html).

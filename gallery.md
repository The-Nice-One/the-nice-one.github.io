Some of my artwork created throughout the years. In particular pixel-art which I find very appealing and fun to draw.

Created November 1st, 2025, this avatar portrays the [Midnight](#midnight) scene during sunset. I detailed a city background and made the scene lively using different yellow and orange tones included in the [Duel](https://lospec.com/palette-list/duel) color palette. 

\header{Train Night Scene}{train-night-scene}

\pixelImage{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/The-Nice-One/GalleryArt/refs/heads/main/scenes/TrainNightScenePreview.gif}

Created summer of 2025, this scene uses the [The Crow](https://lospec.com/palette-list/the-crow) color palette. It depicts a train traveling through a night sky with a handful of animations giving life to the scene. Additionally, this artwork doubles as a playground project as the frames where generated using Julia. Read more about the project [here](/playground/train-night-scene/index.html).
